# Enudge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.1.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server on Cloud9, or 'ng serve' on a development server of your choice. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project, or, if hosting on Github, ng build --prod --output-path dist --base-href "/enudge/". The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Host on Github Pages

This requires installing the angular-cli-pages library locally. Here is a good tutorial for that: https://alligator.io/angular/deploying-angular-app-github-pages/
Follow the instructions for your build above, then deploy with 'npx ngh'.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
